Algorithms start
Algorithms basics
hashing --> my thinking --> good for searching, adding , removing values
balanced search trees (bst) --> better for ordered values, and ordered based operations
divide and conquer,
greedy method
dynamic programming

sorting and graph search
stable match (stable marriage example)
linear programming, optimization problem, used some kind of polyhedral shape for example to explain
Efficiency :  performance AND resources
P, NP
NP completeness
dealing with NP problems
approximation 
heuristic algorithms
