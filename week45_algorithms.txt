Algorithms start
Algorithms basics
hashing --> my thinking --> good for searching, adding , removing values
balanced search trees (bst) --> better for ordered values, and ordered based operations
divide and conquer,
greedy method
dynamic programming

sorting and graph search
stable match (stable marriage example)
linear programming, optimization problem, used some kind of polyhedral shape for example to explain
Efficiency :  performance AND resources
P, NP
NP completeness
dealing with NP problems
approximation 
heuristic algorithms

==============================

Personal Genome Start
Genetic Sequence
very large size, 10^9
of that genome, majority defines human, ~0.1% defines charecteristics, 
of that part, majority of part is commmon, very small part is specific to each person,
common sequnces majorly small and complex effect
rare sequences occur rarely but usually effect is obvious(you can say)

studying genomics
a standard average genome
takes a person's genome,
make parts of standard genome as hash keys,
and then find parts of sample genome and find in hash,
all linear operations

effect of genomes on diseases, 
also a case k other genome also effecting, proxy genome
perfect proxy and more common occuring imperfect proxy
Personnal genomes per study and also other factors change it like environment, (socia-economic conditions, etc)

interconnected between genomes
in example, found connectedness in hierarchy and origins
k kn kis ziada qareebi rishtedaar he
and explained linear (hash) algorithm instead of n^2 algorithm for this

Machine learning start
relation of algorithms and machine learning

cases explain jese schrizopenia, breast cancer etc

conclusion -- coonnection with data science:
data size requires single scan
messy and probablistic
connections are a challenge





machine learning basics
knn classification - uses all dataset for classification
k = 3, experimentally good

kafi cheezon baad
classification
linear classifier
maximum distance between classes
SVM - support vector machine

for multilclasses, ensemble classification, e.g AdaBoost and Random forests,
