data mining - a technique to extract useful information from raw data, some purani example,
if customers buy some A thing, they also buy B thing along with it,,.

example:
receipt -> items
rice -> beans

'support' is when both items are in receipt
'confidence' is when IF rice occurs in receipt, the beans also exist there
probability and conditional probablity is used (P (B|A)/ P(A)) :: Probability of occurence of B provided A is present, divided by probability of occurence of A.

then, contigency table having count of all items bought together type
and we also require the frequency of individual items as well,
then, in coding, instead of using arrays, using hash to save space ( and time too).

Output is the probability of events with each other.
