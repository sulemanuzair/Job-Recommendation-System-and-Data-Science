# Data Science
This repository contains the information in form of texts, code and output in form of visualizations and text while learning data science.

The sequence followed as:
# Learning Python
Learning python language and more importantly specific to DS particularly python basics, lists, numpy and pandas libraries in python.
# Statistics and Probability
Some basic of statistics and probability as these are the base of machine learning and data science.
