Recommendation system:
Non personalized, content based


(Users's) Preference Model:
Explicit actions
Implicit actions

likes(thumbs up) vs rating

when the users's preference is collected:
- consumption
- memory
- expectation

Implicit examples:
image
links purchase
clicks 
videos
etc


Implicit data benefits from larger volumes

Predictions and Recommendations
explicit vs organic recommendations
some examples of recommendations and predictions, 
top n, recommeneded, etc

balance between explicit and organic recommendations

analytical framework for recommendation system:
dimensions of analysis:

Domain : what are you recommending
Purpose of recommendation:
Context: what is the user doing, etc ?
Personalization level:
Privacy and Trustworthiness:
Interfaces: Explicit and implicit
Recommendation Algorithms


Basic Model
user
items
ratings
(community)

Non personalized recommenders

Content Based Filtering
	it has a user model
	attributes for items and (ratings calculate for that attributes)\

Collaborative Filtering
	User -User
	item -Item

exploit vs explore




############################
Non personalized 
e.g case, for new users

Weakly Personalized

avg and stats, distribution
geography, age, context popular sauce for a specific food)

each users' rating issues, conflicts between users in preferences


Ranking Considerations: 
	confidence
	risk tolerance
	domain and business considerations


damping and time decaying posts etc



demographics in recommendation:
break down summary statistics by demographics

mixing different demographics
multiple regression model
linear regression and logistic regression (e.g: rating vs buy, not buy)

Demographics and related approaches


"One more thought … if you’re thinking about educational recommenders, different types of demographics might be useful. If you have information on learning styles, for instance (sometimes considered psychographics), it might help narrow down which course among alternatives is most likely to be successful in helping a student learn."
Quote taken from Coursera Recommender System Course


Product Association Recommendation
Association Rule Mining- Not part of this course majorly

Businesses filter what they need to recommend e.g product association car and gloves vs cloth and living room set

Use context to provide more relevant recommendations: ice cream with ketchup
transaction history, with time, people buy new things, similar people might buy similar products later

recommendation : whdreplacement vs add-on(s)



ASSIGNMENT : 



mean and damped mean



Content Based Recommenders:
Content based preferences, attributes
Key Idea: Model items according to relevant attributes
	  Model or reveal user preferences by attributes

	keywords, tags, 
	harder to find complements than substitute

	phases and n-grams e.g
		computer science
			 and
		computer, science separate separate, far from each other

	significance: job title, job description
	general quality or authority
	implied tags or content
	
	stemming: different ending but same root
	stopping: stop words, useless words
	vector space model
 	
features, tags, words

	item attributes using features, tags, words
	user profile using features, attributes,
	
Interview of knowledge based recommendation systems

Interview case based reasoning: use past experience to solve new problems, example of reviews of app macbook review
Interview critique based recommendation: 
Interview search and recommendation, and context
Interview, including semantics, word embeddings, etc

search and recommendation

score function, order function for recommendation

ASSIGNMENT 1 IMPORTANT THINGS:  => Summary Stats, Product Association, Demographic Analysis

 
 
 User - User similarity
    conditionss : limit users to find similarity with due to:
		limit size to similar users
		minimum simarility baseline
		not find similarity with the user itself(obvious)
		dealing with negative simarility
		Computation issues
		
		
		
		How to set neighbours for a user,
			all users,
			based on similairty,
			random,
			top n closest with similarity,
			clusters,
				with the case that users with less similairty can cause noise
				
				starting line : top n 30 neighbours, wighthed aerageing, user-mean or z-score normailization,  cosine similairy over normalized ratings
				
				Computing similairties wtith pearson correlation(check)
				Interview Influence Limiting and Attack Resistance
				
2 lectures notes on paper

item - item Unary data
cosine and /vs conditional probability				
			
extensions and hybrids in item-item
	trust aware collaborative filtering
	page-rank for important item
	similarity measures in item-item collaborative filtering can be changed to any similarity measure, even content similarity





Cold start problem: new user:
	show popular items, demographcally relevant, etc
New item cold start problem: content based type, or show it to some(depends) to get feedbacks on it



interview - recommending for groups:
doodle application for group meeting

Threat models in recommendations:
make recommendations accurate and resilient if malicious users try to manipulate recommendations





One whole video on --> giving users info about recommendation, the simpler, the better,
(graphs, explanation, etc)

giving/explaning the users about the recommendation:
	more data on the prediction itself,
	other data about the item,
	simplifiedn presentations of relevant data,
	past performance data,
	supporting statistics,\
