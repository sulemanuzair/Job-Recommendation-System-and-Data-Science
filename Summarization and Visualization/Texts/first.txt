The data is being explored and it is a subset of the data, most probably 1% or 5% or in between.
exporing data, users file,
User file has 4719 rows in this subset.
ManagedOthers attribute in user table has 4719 (all rows filled) only with yes/no value.
Managed others : out of 4719 rows, 'no' in 3908 rows, yes in 811 rows.
Add a histogram for these values.
Histogram added, clearly seen from histogram most of our users have not managed before, almost 20% of users have managed.
Graph:

Analysing states, first tried histogram, faced some problems in the output/visualization.
Added state coordiniates, and following the same strategy as of cities (drawn on coordinates, with circle cycle representing users)
graph added for state population
users_population_in_states.png
can compare city and states graph
also added file to add state latitude and longitude in our users file
states_location.py

zip code
read(past) about them online, used for postal purposes, have information about location,
but at present, considering only city and state

out of approx 5000 users, 963 have Not Applicable major, it could mean not provided
While Business Administration has 137, and accounting has 79 count.

also done word count on the major column, its result is also stored in file. (also added a graph -> user_major_word_count_pie.png)

graduation_date_pie_chart.png
so, majority of the users are from 2010-2015(more than 25%), less experienced, and almost more than 75% from 1990-2015

now, starting to work on work history fields,
WorkHistoryCount,
0 zeros with empty field
balanced graph (non-skewed),, bell shaped graph

TotalYearsExperience
190 empty rows
25% person users with 0-5years experience
more than 25% with 5-10 years experience
10-15 years experienced users are also a big chunk of users
data is skewed, can be seen from graphs
